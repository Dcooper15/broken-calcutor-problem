# The Calculator is BUSTED!

This repo is based on the final calculator code that we finished in class.

There are at _least_ 10 different bugs in this code. They can be, but aren't limited to, any of the following:

- Typos
- Incorrect Math
- Incorrect Types (strings/integers)

Your job is make this code work. Find the bugs, fix'em, do some math!


<h1>UPDATE: THESE BUGS ARE SQUASHED</h2>

<h2>This calculator is fully functional and additional functionality has been added</h2>
